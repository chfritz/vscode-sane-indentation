# VSCode Extension: Sane-indentation

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cfritz.sane-indentation

Ports the long-term atom package of the same name to VS Code. Adds a new command `sane-indentation.indentLine` (Sanely indent lines) which uses a tree-sitter parse tree to suggest the most sane indentation for it. This is independent of previous lines.
